It is unclear if he was followed or tracked, or perhaps he will instantly be tortured or murdered  once he enters the nation again. But that doesn't change anything. Puyi has stated his most loyal followers are near the  Imperial Palace of Manchukuo were he currently residences, he doesn't know the actual strength of the rebels in the area, but speaks about the anti-Japanese sentiment in the area, which could cause men who may be completely complacent about the Emperor, to jump in arms. All he requests is that he is allowed to return and presume a luxurious though normal life in Nanjing"
